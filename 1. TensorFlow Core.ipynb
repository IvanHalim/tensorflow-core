    "This guide gets you started programming in the low-level TensorFlow APIs (TensorFlow Core), showing you how to:\n",
    "-  Manage your own TensorFlow program (a `tf.Graph`) and TensorFlow runtime (a `tf.Session`), instead of relying on Estimators to manage them.\n",
    "-  Run TensorFlow operations, using a `tf.Session`.\n",
    "-  Use high level components (datasets, layers, and feature_columns) in this low level environment.\n",
    "-  Build your own training loop, instead of using the one provided by Estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using the higher level APIs to build models when possible. Knowing TensorFlow Core is valuable for the following reasons:\n",
    "-  Experimentation and debugging are both more straight forward when you can use low level TensorFlow operations directly.\n",
    "-  It gives you a mental model of how things work internally when using the higher level APIs.\n",

    "Before using this guide, install TensorFlow.\n",

    "To get the most out of this guide, you should know the following:\n",
    "-  How to program in Python.\n",
    "-  At least a little bit about arrays.\n",
    "-  Ideally, something about machine learning.\n",

    "The central unit of data in TensorFlow is the __tensor__. A tensor consists of a set of primitive values shaped into an array of any number of dimensions. A tensor's __rank__ is its number of dimensions, while its __shape__ is a tuple of integers specifying the array's length along each dimension. Here are some examples of tensor values:\n",
