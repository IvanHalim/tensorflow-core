    "\n",
    "This guide gets you started programming in the low-level TensorFlow APIs (TensorFlow Core), showing you how to:\n",
    "-  Manage your own TensorFlow program (a `tf.Graph`) and TensorFlow runtime (a `tf.Session`), instead of relying on Estimators to manage them.\n",
    "-  Run TensorFlow operations, using a `tf.Session`.\n",
    "-  Use high level components (datasets, layers, and feature_columns) in this low level environment.\n",
    "-  Build your own training loop, instead of using the one provided by Estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using the higher level APIs to build models when possible. Knowing TensorFlow Core is valuable for the following reasons:\n",
    "-  Experimentation and debugging are both more straight forward when you can use low level TensorFlow operations directly.\n",
    "-  It gives you a mental model of how things work internally when using the higher level APIs.\n",

    "To get the most out of this guide, you should know the following:\n",
    "-  How to program in Python.\n",
    "-  At least a little bit about arrays.\n",
    "-  Ideally, something about machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to launch `python` and follow along with this walkthrough. Run the following lines to set up your Python environment:"

    "## Tensor Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The central unit of data in TensorFlow is the __tensor__. A tensor consists of a set of primitive values shaped into an array of any number of dimensions. A tensor's __rank__ is its number of dimensions, while its __shape__ is a tuple of integers specifying the array's length along each dimension. Here are some examples of tensor values:\n",

    " [1., 2., 3.] # a rank 1 tensor; a vector with shape [3]\n",

    "2. Running the computational graph (using a `tf.Session`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A __computational graph__ is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph. The graph is composed of two types of objects.\n",
    "-  `tf.Operation` (or \"ops\"): The nodes of the graph. Operations describe calculations that consume and produce tensors.\n",
    "-  `tf.Tensor`: The edges in the graph. These represent the values that will flow through the graph. Most TensorFlow functions return `tf.Tensors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Important: tf.Tensors__ do not have values, they are just handles to elements in the computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a simple computational graph. The most basic operation is a constant. The Python function that builds the operation takes a tensor value as input. The resulting operation takes no inputs. When run, it outputs the value that was passed to the constructor. We can create two floating point constants `a` and `b` as follows:"

    "\n",
    "Each operation in a graph is given a unique name. This name is independent of the names the objects are assigned to in Python. Tensors are named after the operation that produces them followed by an output index, as in `\"add:0\"` above.\n",
